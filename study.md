# Web Accessibility Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Accessibility is...

The measure of usability by persons with one or more disabilities.

The concept of accessible design ensures both:

- “direct access” — unassisted
- “indirect access” — compatibility with a person's assistive technology

## Categorizing Accessibility

There are four major categories of accessibility:

- Visual (myopia, color blindness, glaucoma, albinism)
- Auditory  (acoustic trauma, auditory processing disorder, otosclerosis)
- Motor (cerebral palsy, parkinson’s, muscular dystrophy)
- Cognitive (down’s syndrome, autism, global developmental delay, dyslexia)

## The Legality Of It All

Why is accessibility important? In the eyes of the law, _not_ providing
accessible technology, especially in cases of providing goods and services
through those technologies, can be a form of discrimination.

In 2008 Target was sued by the National Federation of the Blind because its
website was not accessible to visually impaired people who used screenreaders
to experience the web. The total cost to Target was well over $13 Million:

- Class damages of $6 million
- Plaintiff legal fees over $3.7 million
- Undisclosed defense legal fees (estimated to be nearly $4 Million)
- Additionally, they were subject to court oversight of their website for
several years.

In addition to be subjected to 3rd party lawsuits, companies can be fined
under the American's with Disabilities Act (ADA). In a recent case against
Winn-Dixie, the courts ruled in favor of the Department of Justice who had
argued that "discrimination applies to the provision of goods and services
of a place of public accommodation, rather than just those goods and
services at or in a place of public accommodation."

In addition to risk mitigation, it is simply the right thing to do.
The WHO reported in 2012 that there were 285 million visually impaired
people in the world, of them 39 million are completely blind, and these are
only the statistics for a single group of people with disabilities.

The web is an incredible resource, especially for those who may not have
regular access to certain resources or services without it. It is
our responsibility as web developers to then not fail those people who may
rely on our products.
